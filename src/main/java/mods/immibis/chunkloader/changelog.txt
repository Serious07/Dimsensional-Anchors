* Updated to Minecraft 1.5.1.

53.0.0:
* Updated to Minecraft 1.5.
* New bug: F9 overlay is broken - need a Forge change or a coremod to fix.

52.2.0:
* F9 overlay changes:
  - The blue border is always shown around your current chunk, even if it's not force-loaded.
  - The blue border around your current chunk is lighter now.
  - Chunks which are force-loaded by other mods will have a yellow square above them, instead of red.
  - Chunks which are force-loaded by both DA and another mod will have an orange square above them.
  - Chunks with multiple chunk loaders force-loading them will not be highlighted in darker red - this was a side effect of internal changes.
  - Server-owned chunk loaders are highlighted yellowish-green.
* Added shapes. Currently you can use a square (previously the only option) or a line in either axis.
* Added a display of the amount of fuel left, if fuel is turned on, in the chunk loader GUI.

52.1.9:

52.0.7:

* Per-player overrides added to config. In immibis.cfg, section chunkloader.playerQuotaOverride,
  add entries of the form: '<username (lowercase)>=<number of chunks they can have loaded>'
  or '<username (lowercase)>=unlimited' (without the <> or '')
  This overrides everything else including ops having unlimited quota.

50.0.0pr2:
